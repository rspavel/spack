class Cogl(CMakePackage):
    """CoGL is a stand-alone meso-scale simulation code used to analyze pattern
    formation in ferroelastic materials using the Ginzburgâ€“Landau approach. It
    models transitions from a face-centered cubic parent phase to a
    body-centered tetragonal product phase due to either a rapid decrease in
    temperature or an external deformation. By solving the force balance
    equations that use a nonlinear elastic free-energy functional and also
    incorporate inertial and viscous forces, the strains are computed at each
    point on a regular three-dimensional grid. The code allows the study of
    nucleation and growth of phase changes on loading-unloading and
    heating-cooling protocols as a function of strain rates."""
